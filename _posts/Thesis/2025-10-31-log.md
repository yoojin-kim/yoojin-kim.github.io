# Starcoder dataload problem

```

## [Findings]
1. Compute Node 의 인터넷 문제가 아님. 
2. Token 문제 (가능성이 있어서 replace 해보았지만 문제는 계속됨)
3. `[결론]` : datasets library 버전이 낮아서 문제였던것.. ㅠㅠ

$ pip install --upgrade huggingface_hub datasets

`/마지막 에러가 뜨긴 했지만 일단 나중에 다시 보는 걸로/`

이후 스타코더 테스트 돌려보면 또 에러
```shell
(pytorch310) [kim@slurm-login t3]$ cat starcoder_diag_err_302327.txt 
Traceback (most recent call last):

시각 : 23:33 너무 늦었다..! 정리만하고 frustrating 한 이메일만 보내고 가려고 했는데 갑자기 되는건 뭐람

## 하나
```shell
(base) [kim@slurm-login sort]$ cat starcoder_diag_err_302335.txt 

[CRITICAL ERROR] HfApi connection FAILED.
This proves the problem is your TOKEN or ACCOUNT PERMISSIONS.
The error '401 Client Error' means 'Unauthorized'.
The error '404 Client Error' means 'Not Found' (or access denied).

틀린 url 을 계속 reference 하는 것을 발견함. 이걸 수정했음. 
>Because I set repo_type="dataset", the huggingface_hub library automatically looked for a dataset at the API endpoint .../api/datasets/bigcode/starcoder.
But bigcode/starcoder is not a dataset repository. It is a MODEL repository.

그래서 두개로 나눠서 테스트 :
- Test A: Let's first confirm your token works for the model repo bigcode/starcoder by setting repo_type="model".

- Test B: The dataset used to train this model is actually called bigcode/starcoderdata. This is most likely the dataset you want for your Fill-in-the-Middle task. Let's try to access that dataset.

Test A 는 순조롭게 통과 한 반면
Test B 는
```shell
[ERROR] Failed to load 'starcoderdata' dataset.
This likely means your account does not have access to this *specific* dataset.
Please check your access for 'bigcode/starcoderdata' on the HF website.
Error Details: Dataset 'bigcode/starcoderdata' is a gated dataset on the Hub. Visit the dataset page at https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/starcoderdata to ask for access.
```

그래서 위 사이트를 다시한번 방문하니 진짜... Access granted 가 __!제대로 안되어 있었던 것...!__  
몇번이고 수백번이고 확인했었을 땐 >granted< 라며 siballoma

이후엔 
```shell
Error Details: BuilderConfig 'python' not found. Available: ['default']
```
DATASET_CONFIG = "python" 를 DATASET_CONFIG = "default" 로 바꿔주면.

앞전과는 완전 다른 에러가 떨어짐 !
```shell
/var/spool/slurm/slurmd/job302340/slurm_script: line 36: 3229079 Aborted                 (core dumped) python test_starcoder_dataset.py
```

는 내일 ^^ 해결 하는 거로...
