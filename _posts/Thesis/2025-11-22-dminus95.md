The Forward Pass testing is not quite working pretty well. 

### causal-conv1d not successfully installed. (!)

처음부터 차근츠근...ㅜ
>pip install torch  

>pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers  
...  
Successfully installed hf-xet-1.2.0 huggingface-hub-1.0.1 safetensors-0.7.0 tokenizers-0.22.1 transformers-5.0.0.dev0

>pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate  
> ...  
> Successfully installed accelerate-1.13.0.dev0

>pip install huggingface_hub  

->> 안됨. 근데 이건 pyarrow 라이브러리 이슈 어쩌고 ;  
conda remove pyarrow  
conda install pyarrow  
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

안됨 안됨 다 안됨.. ㅠㅠ < 왤까요? 왜 남은 되고 나는 안되냐구요

```shell
error: subprocess-exited-with-error
  
  × Building wheel for causal-conv1d (pyproject.toml) did not run successfully.
  │ exit code: 1
  ╰─> [54 lines of output]
  
  [...]
  
error: command '/usr/bin/g++' failed with exit code 1
  [end of output]
  
  note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.
  ERROR: Failed building wheel for causal-conv1d

된줄 알았는데, 내일 다시 설치 해야겠다. ㅜㅜ
