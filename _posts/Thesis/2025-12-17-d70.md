# Project Sync / Status Update Summary

## Model Configuration Issues

- Vocabulary Size Problem: The current configuration has an incorrect vocab size 
(32101 instead of 32102) causing index errors

- Configuration File Requirements:
  - Need to use YAML configuration file instead of direct model creation 
  - Should load the recommended YAML file for proper model initialization 
  - Must use configuration_gen instead of configuration_pegs for the generative model

## Model Head Implementation

- Current Status: Using MLM head from the existing implementation
- Required Investigation: Need to research how transformer heads are implemented for decoder-only models
- Decision Pending: Determine whether to modify the existing MLM head or implement a new head based on transformer library standards

## Training Environment Setup

- GPU Configuration: Code is running on GPU successfully

- CUDA Version: Currently using CUDA 11.8, though the spectral states model was designed for CUDA 12.4

- Development Environment Issues:
  - VS Code remote SSH connection problems causing frequent logouts 
  - Workaround: Using terminal and Jupyter Notebook for development 
  - Jupyter Notebook can be run without GPU allocation to preserve resources

## Model Training Progress

- Dataset: Using the same categorized datasets (good issues followed by code)

- Model Type: Switched to Mamba model configuration while maintaining the same training approach

- Monitoring Requirements:
  - Implement Weights & Biases (W&B) for tracking training metrics 
  - Plot loss, accuracy, and perplexity during training 
  - Generate visualizations for thesis documentation

## Thesis Timeline

- Submission Deadline: Confirmed thesis submission date

- Scope: Empirical study on autoregressive state space models

- Approach: Focus on detailed study of current model performance rather than achieving state-of-the-art results

## Action Items

- [ ] Fix vocabulary size configuration (change from 32101 to 32102)

- [ ] Implement YAML configuration file loading

- [ ] Research transformer head implementations for decoder-only models

- [ ] Set up Weights & Biases for training monitoring

- [ ] Plot training metrics (loss, accuracy, perplexity)

- [ ] Schedule next meeting for Monday (before two-week break)
